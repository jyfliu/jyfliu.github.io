  <h2>Automated Geometry Theorem Prover</h2>
  <p>Automatically prove geometry theorems. Accepts a description of a geometric problem/theorem and outputs a proof in english of the geometric proof.
  Eventually, the plan is to output a machine-verifiable proof (ie., Lean or Coq) and experiment with modern techniques (machine learning, ai, etc).</p>

  <h2>Optimization library | C++ </h2>
  <p>A c++ library with implementations of various algorithms to solve linear, convex, and integer programming problems, and more. Includes implementations from
  some of my coursework (CO 255, CO 663) and sources in literature.</p>

  <h2>Vimim (VIM IMproved)</h2>
  <p>Clone of Vim and extremely try-hard CS 246e project. Features include: Syntax highlighting, basic vim script, recording and macros, display splits, and ray
  tracing. I'm not allowed to post the source so here is a picture and a <a href="res/design.pdf">link</a> to our design document.</p>

  <h2>TOPS AP Physics</h2>
  <p>We made this cute little minesweeping robot with omni wheels to detect mines (soup can lids) and safely dispose of them. Part of our larger (and more
  serious) physics class. Some of our lab reports and papers <a href="https://github.com/jyfliu/AP-Physics-C">here</a>.</p>

  <!--<h2>Stock Terminal | Python</h2>-->
  <!--<p>Plots level two quotes and uses statistics (or machine learning for any buzzword enthusiasts) to recommend stocks. Slowly a work in progress. (private-->
  <!--repo)</p>-->
  <h2>This website</h2>
  <p>My (modest) website made with pure html. Maybe one day I'll find time to add CSS and make it a bit prettier. Hopefully the content and personality is more
  important to you than the outwards appearance :). Shoutouts to the country of Estonia for their awesome top level domain, their e-Residency program, and their
  beautiful flag.</p>
