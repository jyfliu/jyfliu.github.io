	<h1> Hi! My name is Jeffrey!</h1>
	<p>I'm formerly a math/cs Olympiad competitor, currently a 1B student at
	the University of Waterloo, and futurely a software engineering intern at Wish. 
	I'm pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization,
	as well as a minor in Statistics. Unfortunately (fortunately?), I am not super
	experienced in front-end web development.</p>
