  <h2>MATH Courses</h2>
  <h4>Math 145 - David Jao</h4>
  <p>A lot of people say this is the best course they've ever taken. IMO that's because they take this course in first year, and so they don't really have much
  to compare to. I think if you've never seen the content before, this can be a really interesting course. You'll definitely learn a lot and have a lot of fun
  "researching" math. On the other hand, Jao isn't the best lecturer and you might find the course tedius if you've seen everything before. If you're in the
  latter group then this will be the easiest 100 you'll ever get in your life. Trust me.</p>
  <h4>Math 147 - Ken Davidson</h4>
  <p>This is a pretty typical first year math course. etc</p>
  <h4>Math 146 - Ross Willard</h4>
  <h4>Math 148 - Laurent Marcoux</h4>
  <h4>Math 245 - Rahim Moosa</h4>
