  <p>Just some stuff I find interesting/useful/can't remember. Permanently WIP</p>
  <p><a href="down2learn/co_463_notes.pdf", style="color:blue">Nonlinear Optimization</a><br>Convexity theory, extensions, applications. Descent,
  trust region, interior point, and ellipsoid methods. Non-convex continuous optimization. Combines CO 463/466/471 (+ my own commentary).</p>
  <p><a href="#", style="color:blue">Linear Algebra</a><br>Anthology of various linear algebra theorems I can't remember. Focuses on stuff useful for
  optimization/machine learning. To be uploaded.</p>
  <p>Other cool stuff I want to get better at: PÃ³lya enumeration (and other counting stuff). Differential Geometry. Spectral graph theory.</p>
