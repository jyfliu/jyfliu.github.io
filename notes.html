  <p>Just some stuff I find interesting/useful/can't remember. Always WIP</p>
  <p><a href="#", style="color:blue">Convex Analysis and Optimization</a><br>Convexity theory, extensions, applications. Descent, trust region, interior point,
  and ellipsoid methods. Combines and extends on CO 463/466/471.</p>
  <p><a href="#", style="color:blue">Linear Algebra</a><br>Anthology of various linear algebra theorems I can't remember. Focuses on stuff useful for
  optimization/machine learning.</p>
  <p><a href="#", style="color:blue">What they don't teach you in CS 251</a><br>How to write fast code for your cpu/gpu.</p>
  <p>Other cool stuff I want to get better at: PÃ³lya enumeration (and other counting stuff). Differential Geometry. Spectral graph theory.</p>
