  <p style="width:70%">A small selection of some my acrylic/watercolour paintings from back in the day. There are a few oil paintings and ink/pencil sketches I'd like to upload too. I
  had a lot of fun sketching/painting, and I'm trying to make more time to pursue it as a hobby. Come back later for my 202x collection!</p>
